## Project Day 13: Random Ron
[Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/)

In today’s project, we’re going to create a site that displays a random Ron Swanson quote (from the show Parks and Recreation) using the Ron Swanson Quotes API.

Here’s the API endpoint:
```
http://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes
```


####The Template
When the page loads, a random quote from the Ron Swanson Quotes API should be displayed in the blockquote element.

When the More Ron button is clicked, a new quote from the API should replace the current one.


```html
<blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
	<button>More Ron</button>
</p>
```
